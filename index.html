  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>Progressive enhancement is important in modern web design because everyone should be able to have the same level of experience when visiting websites.  
    I actually see how the graceful degradation perspective is attractive to some web developers.  We would all love to be able to use and experience the latest, 
    greatest and flashiest (if that is a word) tricks of the trade when designing and/or using a web space, however, progressive enhancement is more inclusive.</p>
  <p>Graceful degradation takes the userâ€™s browser into consideration, but progressive enhancement does not care about browsers or what their current level is.  
    Progressive enhancement is all about the content, which in my opinion is the most important thing.  You can make the greatest web page ever, but if only a 
    fraction of the potential users will be able to experience it as intended, it kind of defeats the purpose of having a web page entirely.  As a company, you 
    want your content to be consumed.  You want the users to be able to clearly understand what your services are and what you offer.  Content is king.</p>
  <p>I really like the M&M analogy that the article used.  It clearly shows that the content is the center and most important part (the peanut), then you style it 
    with CSS (the chocolate), then add a little JavaScript (the thin candy shell).  You want every potential user to be able to clearly understand and consume the 
    content, whether they are using an older browser, a browser with the latest and greatest updates, or a mobile device.</p>

  <h2>Dragon Project - Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>After completing the first draft of the project, I had my wife look over the web page and use it so she could give me honest feedback about the usability,
     and if there was anything that was annoying as a user or something that didn't look quite right, etc.  She looked it over and said that everything looked great.
       I wasn't really satisfied with that feedback, because I knew that I certainly did not design the perfect web page.  Insert laughter here.  I then reached out to 
       my brother, who is currently in a doctorate program for English at the University of Indiana.  I knew that he would probably be a little more critical.  The first 
       thing he mentioned was that the background was little harsh.  It was stark white.  After looking at my CSS, I realized that I hadn't set an actual background color.  
       I ended up setting it to a light gray in the revision.  The other note that he had was the picture I had on the homepage, the Dragon exterior picture.  It was just 
       kind of in the middle of the page and didn't really look that great positioned that way, after a paragraph.  I changed it by aligning it to the right side, beside 
       the text, and it did seem to look quite a bit better positioned there.  These were the only two feedback items I received.
  </p>
  <p>One thing that I believe I did well was adding CSS for styling.  I was pretty happy with how I was actually able to absorb enough knowledge and be able to utilize 
    different styling methods to make a somewhat decent looking webpage.  If I had to do it over, I don't think I would have done much of anything differently as far as 
    CSS goes, but I probably would have brushed up on the JavaScript lessons we had and added a little bit of that for some flare.  I also could have done something better 
    for the list under the Configurations section on the home page.  Maybe set them up as articles.  I surprisingly enjoyed this class.  I say that is surprising because I 
    really do not like programming.  It's extremely frustrating and requires a lot of practice to actually burn it into your brain.  This class was not like that, at least 
    not too much.  If I didn't have my heart set on pursuing a career in Cybersecurity, I could definitely see myself going all in on web development.
